Although we can see that some of the examples can be contradictory and there is not quantitative way to evaluate the best example(which is a major disadvantage of this algorithm). But we can clearly comment that if the person decides to go for higher eductaion or increase his work rate he can get a higher pay. Also, usually it is observed that when a person gets married, the annual income also increases. This is a correlation which has been observed from the data.
